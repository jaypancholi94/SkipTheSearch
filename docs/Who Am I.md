# Who Am I‚ùì
I'm Jay Pancholi, a Full Stack Developer based in Melbourne. I've always been passionate about crafting efficient and elegant solutions through code, which is why I enjoy software development so much. I find it incredibly fulfilling to build digital tools and experiences that are not only functional but also delightful to use. I believe that well-written code can simplify complexities and have meaningful impact on both developers and end users.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy computer gaming, hiking, and scuba diving, scuba is my absolute favourite way to unwind and explore the underwater. I'm also a bit of a keyboard enthusiast, constantly perfecting my setup, and I love optimizing my workflow with tools like [[LazyVim]] & [[Tmux]]. Whether it's diving into new technology or discovering a new, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and continuously improve, in my coding journey and in life.
